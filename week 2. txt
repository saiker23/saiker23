 Define and give examples (in code, preferably) for the particular language you are learning.
Don't worry if you can't do them all. Do as many as you can.

What is a compiler? What is an interpreter? Which one does your programming language use? (It may use both).

What is a class? What is an object? What is object-oriented programming?
A class is a blueprint or template or set of instructions to build a specific type of object.
an object is a self-contained component that contains properties and methods needed to make a certain type of data useful.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming that focuses on using objects to design and build applications

In your programming language, how do you use functions and classes written by other people, perhaps that you found on GitHub or the internet?
That is, how do you "import" additional functionality?

What is the difference between the core programming language and a library?
(hint: think about using only keywords, versus having to "import" functions / modules / classes into your program)
